##Information

This was my first attempt at using a UICollectionView aswell as using third party libraries (libactivator).
This tweak was made entierly using filza's simple text editor on a jailbroken iPhone. To avoid working with large files on my device, I tried to make the collectionView as self contained at possible.

Later projects demonstrate various other solutions to filtering arrays and processing data to improve efficiency.
